# D2NT
### Modified to work for D2LOD 1.13

<hr>

Primarily it was missing the proper DLL for Etal which I acquired from another repository other than the bulk of this version's repository. With the proper DLL it avoids the notorious breaking errors it typically had.

<br><br>

When it comes to single player primarily, which is why I bothered recently at all, I made a modification to the character select script in NTBot.ntj. It will take the "Account Name" variable which typically does nothing in single player, and if the user adds the name of the character you want to use in that text box, it will choose that character NO MATTER where it is on the character select screen. This means basically more than one character can be used in single player at one time (instead of juggling whatever characters are in position 0).

Other than these modifications, nothing is sullied with.
